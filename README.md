# Hi, I'm Ramita! 

I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer. Currently, I am contributing to Hack for LA as I continue to design and build full-stack web applications using React, TypeScript and MySQL.

I come from a background as a private music teacher and crafting melodies through songwriting and recording. My skills in teaching and audio engineering have given me experience in self-starting a business and a knack for creativity. Now, I'm diving into the realm of web development. 

### My Projects:
- A full-stack project called <a href="https://mosaic-planner-112e49ce3b90.herokuapp.com/">Mosaic Planner</a>, a productivity web application that combines different aspects of a traditional planner: a calendar, schedule, daily items, reminders/notes, and goals. 
- A full-stack project called <a href="https://the-budget-dashboard.onrender.com/">The Budget Dashboard</a> with @jnc444xd, a web application that helps users keep track of their budgets, organize their expenses and set savings goals.
- A front-end project called <a href="https://ramitaarora.github.io/meal-match/">Meal Match</a>, a recipe web application that allows users to "match" with their ideal meal or drink, much like a dating app. 
- A full-stack project called <a href="https://chit-chat-wechatalot-00f4f8dc2d8e.herokuapp.com/">Chit Chat</a>, a web chat application that allows users to add friends, chat in real time and view their profiles.
