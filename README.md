# Hi, I'm Ramita! 

Hey there! I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer. Currently I am developing a website for Pleasant Hill Instructional Garden and contributing to Hack for LA.

I come from a background as a private teacher and crafting melodies through songwriting and recording. My skills in teaching and audio engineering have given me experience in self-starting a business and a knack for creativity. Now, I'm diving into the realm of web development. 

### I am currently working on:
- A full-stack project called <a href="https://mosaic-planner-112e49ce3b90.herokuapp.com/">Mosaic Planner</a>, a productivity web application that combines different aspects of a traditional planner: a calendar, schedule, daily items, reminders/notes, and goals. 
- A front-end project called <a href="https://ramitaarora.github.io/meal-match/">Meal Match</a>, a recipe web application that allows users to "match" with their ideal meal or drink, much like a dating app. 
- A full-stack project called <a href="https://chit-chat-wechatalot-00f4f8dc2d8e.herokuapp.com/">Chit Chat</a>, a web chat application that allows users to add friends, chat in real time and view their profiles.

### Learning Goals:
- NextJS
- TypeScript
- React Native
- Redux
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- PHP

### Languages and Tools:
